MapReduce simplifies data processing across massive scales. By breaking down large datasets into smaller chunks, MapReduce allows for efficient data processing on many computers. It typically involves two steps: mapping the data, and then reducing it to summarize. This technique helps in data sorting, processing, and aggregation tasks, which are crucial in areas such as search engines and scientific simulations. Hadoop is one of the most well-known frameworks that utilize MapReduce to handle big data.
